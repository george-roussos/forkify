# Forkify

Exercise project off Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

Forkify is an application frontend for recipes. It supports:

- Recipe searching (with redirection to appropriate website)
- Recipe bookmarking (using `localStorage` for _some_ persistence)
- Servings adjusting, based on the number of people
- Recipe uploading (only works with the API used in conjuction, see [here](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/))

Built on vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. For a demo round, you can head to [george-forkify.netlify.app](https://george-forkify.netlify.app). ðŸ˜€
